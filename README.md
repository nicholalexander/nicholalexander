### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Nichol (pronounced like the coin) and I am a software developer.

I really love working with Ruby and Rails.

I also really love working with early career / just-learning / new-to-coding developers, please get in touch!

I drank the coolaid at [Techstars](https://techstars.com)

I also really love nonprofits.

I love lots of things really, even [poetry](https://thesonnetsofshakespeare.com/).

I want to be better at open source contributions.  [Shoes](http://shoesrb.com/) is a great project and very welcoming!

I want to learn to be better at [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

I write sometimes about tech things and other things at [That Aboutness](https://thataboutness.com/).

You can tweet at me on Twitter at [@nicholalexander](https://twitter.com/nicholalexander).

Fun fact!  It's true.
