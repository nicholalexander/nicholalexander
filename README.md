### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Nichol (pronounced like the coin) and I am a human.

I am a Senior Software Engineer at the amazing and awesome [Betterment](https://www.betterment.com/) where I work to build simple and delightful experiences for people to secure their financial future and wellness.

I really love working with Ruby and Rails.

I really love working with early career / just-learning / new-to-coding developers, please get in touch!

I love nonprofits.

I love lots of things really, even [poetry](https://thesonnetsofshakespeare.com/).

I write sometimes about tech things and other things at [That Aboutness](https://thataboutness.com/).

You can find me most places on the internets at `nicholalexander`.
