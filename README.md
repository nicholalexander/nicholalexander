### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Nichol (pronounced like the coin) and I am a software developer.

I really love working with Ruby and Rails.

I also really love working with early career / just-learning / new-to-coding developers.

I also really love nonprofits and startups.

I love lots of things, really.

I want to be better at open source contributions.

I want to learn to be better at Rust.

I write sometimes about tech things and other things at [That Aboutness](https://thataboutness.com/).

You can tweet at me on Twitter at [@nicholalexander](https://twitter.com/nicholalexander).

Fun fact!  It's true.
